            Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009
            In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, <br/>
            a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo <br/>
            proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser <br/>
            and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert <br/>
            Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.<br/>
             In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and <br/>
             put an encyclopedia first. </p><br/>

             <p id="Document">Document type declaration<br/>
                HTML documents are required to start with a Document Type Declaration (informally, a "doctype"). In<br/>
                 browsers, the doctype helps to define the rendering modeâ€”particularly whether to use quirks mode.<br/>
                
                The original purpose of the doctype was to enable parsing and validation of HTML documents by SGML <br/>
                tools based on the Document Type Definition (DTD). The DTD to which the DOCTYPE refers contains a <br/>
                machine-readable grammar specifying the permitted and prohibited content for a document conforming to <br/>
                such a DTD. Browsers, on the other hand, do not implement HTML as an application of SGML and by consequence<br/>
                 do not read the DTD.<br/>
                
                HTML5 does not define a DTD; therefore, in HTML5 the doctype declaration is simpler and shorter</p >
                <p>Attributes
                    Main article: HTML attribute
                    
                    Most of the attributes of an element are name-value pairs, separated by = and written within the start <br/>
                    tag of an element after the element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although<br/>
                     values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML).[73][74] Leaving <br/>
                     attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe.[75] In contrast with name-value pair attributes, there <br/>
                     are some attributes that affect the element simply by their presence in the start tag of the element,[6] <br/>
                     like the ismap attribute for the img element.[76]<br/>
                    <br/>
                    There are several common attributes that may appear in many elements :<br/>
                    
                        The id attribute provides a document-wide unique identifier for an element. This is used to <br/>
                        identify the element so that stylesheets can alter its presentational properties, and scripts <br/>
                        may alter, animate or delete its contents or presentation. Appended to the URL of the page, it <br/>
                        provides a globally unique identifier for the element, typically a sub-section of the page. For <br/>
                        example, the ID "Attributes" in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Attributes.<br/>
                        The class attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements. This can be used for semantic<br/>
                         or presentation purposes. For example, an HTML document might semantically use the designation<br/>
                        to indicate that all elements with this class value are subordinate to the <br/>
                        presented as footnotes on a page instead of appearing in the place where they occur in the <br/>
                        HTML source. Class attributes are used semantically in microformats. Multiple class values <br/>
                        may be specified; for exampleputs the element into both the notation and the important classes.<br/>
                        text of the document. In presentation, such elements might be gathered together and <br/>
                        An author may use the style attribute to assign presentational properties to a particular element.<br/>
                         It is considered better practice to use an element's id or class attributes to select the element<br/>
                          from within a stylesheet, though sometimes this can be too cumbersome for a simple, specific, or<br/>
                           ad hoc styling.<br/>
                        The title attribute is used to attach subtextual explanation to an element. In most browsers this<br/>
                         attribute is displayed as a tooltip.<br/>
                        The lang attribute identifies the natural language of the element's contents, which may be different<br/>
                         from that of the rest of the document. For example, in an English-language document:<br/>
                    
                    </p>
            <title id="Bottom">This is the Bottom</title>
