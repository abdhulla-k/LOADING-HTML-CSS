             However, they serve different functions. A div element is used for block-level organization and styling 
             of page elements, whereas a span element is used for inline organization and styling. -->

        <!-- Difference between id and class attribute: The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a 
            page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements. 
            HTML is the foundation of webpages, is used for webpage development by structuring websites and web apps.-->
